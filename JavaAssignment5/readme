This is the readme file for the fifth assignment in comp106-fall2011. 
Compiling and running my program is quite simple (follows the guidelines 
given). Simply, run "javac Main.java" in order to compile the program (which 
I have already done), and then run "java Main".

As asked, I will try to outline the inheritance, aggregation, collaboration, 
and encapsulation as best I can.

The class inheritance hierarchy is as follows:
----------------------------------------------
Shape
    <- cubeShape
    <- sphereShape
    <- coneShape
    <- cylinderShape

JFrame
    <- Main

JPanel
    <- guiControlPanel


JComboBox
    <- shapeComboBox

JButton
    <- rotateHButton
    <- rotateVButton 
    <- quitButton 


The aggregation hierarchy is as follows:
----------------------------------------
Main
    <- Scene 
       <- Shapes (the 4 subclasses
    <- guiControlPanel
       <- quitButton
       <- rotateVButton
       <- rotateHButton
       <- shapeComboBox 
               
The collaboration relationships are as follows:
-----------------------------------------------
Main
    <- guiControlPanel
        <- Scene
        <- quitButton	
    	<- rotateVButton 
    	    <- Scene
	<- rotateHButton 
    	    <- Scene
        <- shapeComboBox
	
Scene
    <- Shapes
        
The Encapsulation within each class is as follows:
--------------------------------------------------
Scene
    <- the scene class entirely handles initializing the 3d objects as well as
       maintaining them. All other classes must rely on scene in order to 
       affect the 3d shapes. The scene class also initializes the lighting.

guiControlPanel
    <- the guiControlPanel entirely handles laying out the controls at the 
       bottom of the screen. It is responsible for initializing the buttons

Shapes
    <- each shape subclass entirely contains how to draw their unique image

Main
    <- the main class is responsible for initializing the Scene  
       and the guiControlPanel

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some additional functionality I have added to this assignment:
     -I have 4 unique 3D objects of which all have multiple instances.
     -Each Object set can be rotated horizontally or vertically independently
        of the other sets.
     -I have created a very polished tabbed guiControlPanel with a drop down
        menu to select an Object set and buttons to rotate them horizontally
        and vertically
     -I have added lighting to the scene which shows in the shadows on the 
        3D shapes.
     -I have laid out the objects in an 8x8 grid just like in the bejeweled
        game. Also, the shapes are placed randomly as they would at the start
        of a bejeweled game.
