This is the readme file for the first assignment in comp106-fall2011. Compiling and 
running my program is quite simple (follows the guidelines given). Simply, run
"javac Main.java" in order to compile the program (which I have already done), and
then run "java Main".

Some special features I have added to this assignment:

My widgets and drawing area have actual functionality. You'll notice that my program
is a very primitive paint type applet. By clicking and dragging in the drawing area,
you can create shapes. 

You can choose between creating rectangles or ovals by using two of the widgets found 
in the control panel. 

The control panel also contains a widget which clears all drawn shapes, and a widget 
which exits the applet. 

You'll also notice that I made the widgets give a visual comfirmation that they are 
being hovered over.

When pressed, all widgets write a simple confirmation to the command line of what
occurred.

Finally, instead of having an empty state panel I added a simple JLabel to the JPanel
which reads, "This is the State Panel"
